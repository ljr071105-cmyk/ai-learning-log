Your task is to create HTML and CSS for the HoverChair website's “hero” section. HoverChair is a hovercraft-inspired desk chair that floats slightly above the ground, providing a comfortable and exciting seating experience.

Your final result should be an engaging and visually appealing hero section that effectively showcases the HoverChair brand.
